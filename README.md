The tool allows the user to draw or insert a 2D floor plan in order to plan the location(s) of the Wi-Fi access point(s) accordingly. It provides 2 algorithms to find the optimal and the full coverage locations in the correspoding floor plan. It also provides features like plotting the heat of the wireless signals and view the estimated received signal strength at a selected point.
